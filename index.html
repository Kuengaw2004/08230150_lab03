        <p>Hello! I am <b>Kuenga Wangmo</b>, proudly from the beautiful valley of Bumthang. Growing up as the only daughter among three brothers has shaped me to be both caring and independent.

        Iâ€™m an extrovert who enjoys making friends and staying positive. My strength lies in managing time well and completing tasks responsibly, while mathematics has always been my weakness. Still, I found my passion in ICT, where even small challenges motivate me to improve.

        Iâ€™m proud of the person I am todayâ€”simple yet ambitious, finding joy in little things. Music inspires me, and Iâ€™m a proud Central Cee fan.

        As a child, I dreamt of becoming an HRO, but now Iâ€™m on the path to becoming a teacherâ€”a journey I embrace with determination. I believe that losing wealth is little, but losing character is everything, a principle that guides me each day.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          I began my early education at Gaytsa Lower Secondary School, continued at Chumey Middle Secondary School, and finally completed high school at Jakar HSSâ€”all nestled in the serene valleys of Bumthang.
          My entire school life was shaped in this cool, peaceful place, and now my journey has brought me to Samtse College of Educationâ€”a shift from the cold mountains to the warm plains. This transition not only changed my environment but also opened a new chapter of growth and learning.
